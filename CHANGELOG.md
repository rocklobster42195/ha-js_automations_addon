### On the Wire

Scripts now speak MQTT natively.

`ha.mqtt.subscribe()` gives scripts a direct line to the broker — wildcards included. React to raw Tasmota payloads, Zigbee2MQTT messages without the HA integration, DIY hardware, or anything else on the bus.
`ha.mqtt.publish()` sends messages to any topic, with full JSON serialization and retain/QoS support. Subscriptions are scoped to the script and cleaned up automatically on stop.

`ha.register()` now passes unknown config fields directly into the MQTT Discovery payload. This unlocks complex HA domains — register a native `light` with `brightness_command_topic`, a `climate` with `temperature_command_topic`, or a `cover` with `position_topic` — all handled via `ha.mqtt.subscribe()` in the same script.

**What's new**
- `ha.mqtt.subscribe(topic, callback)` — raw broker subscription, returns an unsubscribe function
- `ha.mqtt.publish(topic, payload, options?)` — publish to any topic, auto-JSON serialization
- Wildcard support: `+` (single level) and `#` (multi-level)
- `ha.register()` Discovery passthrough for domain-specific fields
- Graceful no-op when no MQTT broker is configured — scripts warn instead of hanging
